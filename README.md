Below is the thesis abstract:
Air pollution is a critical environmental and public health issue, with particulate matter (PM) having a significant impact on human health through long‑term exposure that can lead to various diseases. Forecasting PM levels has therefore become essential for guiding individual actions and preventive measures, especially in urban contexts like Milan, where pollution is increasingly severe. This paper aims to forecast daily PM₁₀ concentrations at locations not covered by official monitoring stations or low‑cost sensors by employing geostatistical and machine‑learning models. Specifically, we apply Generalized Additive Models and spatio‑temporal kriging, incorporating meteorological variables and land‑cover data. By integrating these heterogeneous data sources, our approach seeks to enhance air‑quality assessment and provide valuable insights into the spatio‑temporal variability of PM₁₀ levels across different areas of the city.
